This is the first section of chapter 7, which is about signal transmission and neuronal coding, i.e., reaction of population of neurons to different inputs.


## Linearized Population Equation

In this section, we linearize the population equation. More specifically, we develop a perturbation theory of the population equations.

1. Input: $I(t)=I_0+\Delta i(t)$. The input is restrained to be a small perturbation upon a constant input.
2. Population activity: $A(t) = A_0 + \Delta A(t)$. We expect the output to be also not changing dramatically. This might not be true if the equation is non-linear, especially for integro-differential equations. In the examples given in Sec. 6.3, this perturbative output assumption is always true. **HOWEVER, WE SHOULD DEFINITELY TAKE NOTE ON THIS CAVEAT.**

From Eq. 6.75, we can derive a "equation" that shows how this method works.

$$
\begin{align}
& A(t) = \int_{-\infty}^t P_I(t|\hat t) A(\hat t) d\hat t\\
\Rightarrow & A_0 + \Delta A(t) =  \int_{-\infty}^t P_I(t|\hat t) A_0 d\hat t + \int_{-\infty}^t P_I(t|\hat t) \Delta A(\hat t) d\hat t\\
\Rightarrow & \Delta A(t) =  A_0 ( -1 + \int_{-\infty}^t P_I(t|\hat t) d\hat t ) + \int_{-\infty}^t P_I(t|\hat t) \Delta A(\hat t) d\hat t.
\label{eqn-perturbation-1}
\end{align}
$$

We would also expect the interval distribution is perturbative under small perturbations of input current, i.e.,

$$
\begin{equation}
P_I(t\vert \hat t) = P_{I_0}(t\vert \hat t) + \Delta P_{I_0}(t\vert \hat t).
\end{equation}
$$

For a perturbation method, we drop all terms with high orders. Thus Eq. ($\ref{eqn-perturbation-1}$) becomes

$$
\begin{equation}
\Delta A(t) =  A_0 \left( -1 + \int_{-\infty}^t P_I(t|\hat t) d\hat t \right) + \int_{-\infty}^t P_{I_0}(t|\hat t) \Delta A(\hat t) d\hat t.
\label{eqn-perturbation-2}
\end{equation}
$$

### Some Simplifications

How to calculate the integral $\int_{-\infty}^t P_I(t\vert\hat t) d\hat t$? For models without noise, we should have

$$
P_I(t\vert \hat t) = P_I(t-\hat t),
$$

which means the spikes depends on the time interval since last spike. The integral $\int_{-\infty}^t P_I(t\vert\hat t) d\hat t$ becomes

$$
\begin{align}
&\int_{-\infty}^t P_I(t\vert\hat t) d\hat t\\
=& - \int_{\hat t = -\infty}^{\hat t=t} P_I(t - \hat t) d (t - \hat t  ) \\
=& - \int_{s =  \infty}^{s=0} P_I(s) ds\\
=& \int^{\infty}_{0} P_I(s) ds.
\end{align}
$$

Eq. ($\ref{eqn-perturbation-2}$) reads

$$
\begin{equation}
\Delta A(t) =  A_0 \left( -1 + \int^{\infty}_{0} P_I(s) ds \right) + \int_{-\infty}^t P_{I_0}(t|\hat t) \Delta A(\hat t) d\hat t.
\label{eqn-perturbation-3}
\end{equation}
$$

### More Simplifications

The problem is reduced to the calculation of $P_I(t\vert\hat t)$. Recall that interval distribution $P_I$ is in fact the time derivative of the survivor function (Sec. 5.2.3). The subscript ${}_I$ indicates the current.

Some review of the definitions.

* Interval distribution is defined as

  $$
  \begin{equation}
  \int_{t_1}^{t_2} dt P_I(t\vert \hat t) = \text{Probability of firing during time interval $[t_1,t_2]$ when the neuron fired at $\hat t$}.
  \end{equation}
  $$
* Survivor function is

  $$
  \begin{equation}
  S(t\vert \hat t) = 1 - \int_{\hat t}^t P_I(t\vert \hat t) dt.
  \end{equation}
  $$

  We also derived

  $$
  \begin{equation}
  P_I(t\vert \hat t) = - \frac{d}{dt} S_I(t\vert \hat t).
  \end{equation}
  $$
* Hazard function is

  $$
  \begin{equation}
  \rho(t\vert\hat t) = -\left(\frac{d}{dt} S(t\vert \hat t)\right)/S(t\vert \hat t) = - P_I(t\vert \hat t)/S_I(t\vert \hat t).
  \end{equation}
  $$

  Meanwhile

  $$
  \rho(t\vert \hat t) S(t\vert \hat t) = P_I(t\vert \hat t).
  $$

> I have no idea how to proceed from the Eq. ($\ref{eqn-perturbation-3}$).


Anyways, the book postulated a solution with multiple integrals,

$$
\begin{equation}
\Delta A(t) = \int_{-\infty}^t P_{I_0}(t-\hat t) \Delta A(\hat t)d\hat t + A_0 \frac{d}{dt}\int_0^\infty \mathcal{L}(x) \Delta h(t-x) dx,
\label{eqn-perturbation-final}
\end{equation}
$$

with

$$
\Delta h(t) = \int_0^\infty \kappa(s) \Delta I(t-s)ds.
$$


### Interpretations

* The first term in Eq. ($\ref{eqn-perturbation-final}$) describes the dependence on the previous population activity perturbation.
* The second term is the dependence on the input variations.
* Low noise limit: kernel $\mathcal L(x) \to \delta(x)$ (**Eq. 6.75 in the book**)

  $$
  \begin{equation}
  \Delta A(t) = \cdots + A_0 \frac{d}{dt} \Delta h(t) = \cdots + A_0 \int_0^\infty ds \, \kappa (s) \frac{d}{dt} \Delta I(t-s).
  \end{equation}
  $$

  This amazing result tells us that any fast change in the input current leads to a large jump in the population activity, regardless of the amplitude of the input current.
* Large noise limit: noise is critical.
  1. Slow noise (**adiabatic limit**): the response of the system is fast enough to keep track on the noise at any time. This is similar to noise-free limit with noise as the effective input or something. Fast changing input means large change in population activity.
  2. Fast noise: the system is too slow to track the noise. The noise is ambient so that the kernel $\mathcal{L}(x)$ becomes broad. In a limit that the kernel is flat, the population activity depends on the amplitude of potential $\Delta h$.


1. Sec. 7.1.1 proves that the noise-free system indeed depends on the time derivative of the input.
2. Sec. 7.1.2 proves that the escape noise, aka fast noise, indeed provides a broad kernel $\mathcal{L}(x)$.

> Rapid change in input might indicate danger for the host of the neural system. This feature might be useful for the survivability of animals.

## Transients

The problem to solve in this section is the time course of population activity under a rapid change of input.

Consider step-like input

$$
\begin{equation}
I(t) = \begin{cases}
I_0 &\qquad t\leq t_0\\
I_0+\Delta I & \qquad t>t_0,
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
$$

which generates step like input potential

$$
\begin{equation}
\Delta h(t) = \begin{cases}
h_0 & \qquad t\leq t_0 \\
h_0 + \Delta I \int_0^{t-t_0} \kappa_0(s)\,ds &\qquad t> t_0.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
$$

As long as the kernel $\kappa$ is defined, we can obtain the time course of every quantity.

We assume the population activity has reached equilibrium (asynchronous firing) before $t_0$. The population activity would also obtain a sudden change

$$
\begin{equation}
A(t) = \begin{cases}
A_0 &\qquad t\leq t_0\\
A_0+\Delta A(t) &\qquad t>t_0.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
$$

This change is called **transient**. During a **short time interval** $[t_0,t_0+\Delta t]$, we expect the first term in Eq. ($\ref{eqn-perturbation-final}$) doesn't contribute because the network has not react to the change at time $t_0$, i.e., $\Delta A(\hat t)=0$. We have to solve

$$
\begin{equation}
\Delta A(t)\sim A_0 \frac{d}{dt}\int_0^\infty \mathcal L(x) \Delta h(t-x) dx,
\end{equation}
$$

for $t-t_0\ll T$, where $T=1/A_0$ is the mean interspike interval.

> As we expected, the short time interval $[t_0,t_0+\Delta t]$ is short enough if $\Delta t\ll 1/A_0$.


### Noise-free Network

For noise-free network, averaging over time is equivalent to averaging over populations (ensembles).

We can inspect a single neuron. A neuron fired at $t_0$ will fire again at $t_0+T$ with $T$ being determined by $u(t_0+T)=\theta$. Meanwhile the theory of population gives us the population activity change

$$
\Delta A(t) = A_0 \frac{d}{dt}\left( \Delta I \int_0^{t-t_0} \kappa_0(s)\,ds \right) \propto A_0\Delta I \kappa_0(t-t_0),
$$

for $t_0< t<t_0+T$.

The solution is written as

$$
\Delta A(t) = a A_0 \kappa_0(t-t_0),
$$

where $a$ can be derived for different models.

> Does it come from the differentiation of time? Not sure how it is derived.

1. SRM0: $a=R\Delta I/\eta'$, where $\eta$ is the intrinsic response;
2. Integrate-and-fire: $a=R\Delta I/u'$.


<div class="notes--extra" markdown="1">
Kernel $\kappa$.

* Integrate and fire model:

  $$
  \kappa_0(s) = \frac{1}{\tau_m} \exp\left( -\frac{s}{\tau_m}\right) \Theta(s).
  $$

</div>

For integrate-and-fire model, we can show that the input potential is

$$
h(t) = h_0 + R \Delta I \left( 1 - \exp\left( -\frac{t-t_0}{\tau_m} \right) \right),
$$

after the input current change, i.e., $t>t_0$. **Within a short period**, $h(t)\sim h_0$. However, as we have derived previously, the population activity change drastically,

$$
\Delta A(t) = a\frac{A_0}{\tau_m} \exp\left( - \frac{t-t_0}{s}\right)\Theta(t-t_0),
$$

for $t_0<t<t_0+T$.

### Transients with Noise

For slow noise, refer to **Fig. 7.6A**.

Some random questions:

1. How to explain the abrupt transient? Before the change of input, there are always neurons at sub-threshold in the population. Increase the input triggers these neurons immediately.
2. Why does the population activity approach another asynchronous state after a long time? Donno.



For fast noise (standart rate mode, or Wilson-Cowan based model), refer to **Fig. 7.6B**.


For SRM0 with escape noise, refer to **Fig. 7.7**.

For diffusive noise, refer to **Fig. 7.8**.
