## Information coding

### time to first spike

In a $\mathrm{SRM_0}$ model, N presynaptic neurons target on **the** postsynaptic neuron. At $t^\mathrm{pre}$, n presynaptic spikes arrive.
$u_i(t)=n*w*\epsilon(t-t^\mathrm{pre})$
$u_i(t)$ is membran potential, $w$ is the constant value of all synaptic weights.
When $u_i(t)$ cross threshold $\theta$, a spike is generated.
So the time difference (time to fist spike) codes the strength of inputs.

### phase coding

Reference is necessary: periodic background signal
Phase codes constant input strength?

### correlation coding

sharing same inputs or connected.

## noise in neuron activities

facts:
in vivo recording revealed noise phenomena in in-tact neuron
fast moving stimuli: no noise
slowly moving stimuli: changing

### noise sources

1. thermal noise
2. number of channels detected
3. multi-inputs from background

## Statistics of spike trains

To reflect noisy neuron activity, input-dependent renewal process is required.
